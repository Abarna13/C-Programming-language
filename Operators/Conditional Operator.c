/*
lets break the problem into part 
(1) At first the condition is sizeof(var)
if this condition is evaluated to be true then  (var2>23 ? ((var==75) ? 'A' : 0) : 0) will be returned 
if false then 0 will be returned 

As we know sizeof() is an unary operator which returns how many byte a datatype can hold 
as var is an variable of integer data type , sizeof(var) will either return 2 or 4 as machine to machine int vary . We know every number except 0 is evaluated to be true. So  (var2>23 ? ((var==75) ? 'A' : 0) : 0) it  will returned 


(2)next the condition is (var2>23)
if this condition is evaluated to be true then   ((var==75) ? 'A' : 0) will be returned 
if false then 0 will be returned
as we know 56>23 is true then ((var==75) ? 'A' : 0) will be returned.


(3)the condition is (var==75)
 if this condition is evaluated to be true then    'A'  will be returned 
if false then 0 will be returned


As 75==75 then 'A' will be returned and stored into num variable 
As c support auto type casting so int can store char.


In the final printf function we use the placeholder %d  and it print integer value .
According to Ascii integer value of 'A' is 65
